# Understanding Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Conquered Crypto

## Origins of a Cultural Phenomenon  
In 2013, software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer created Dogecoin (DOGE) as a lighthearted parody of Bitcoin. What began as a joke featuring the Shiba Inu "Doge" meme unexpectedly evolved into one of cryptocurrency's most enduring success stories. This article explores Dogecoin's transformation from internet novelty to blockchain network with a $80+ billion market cap at its peak.

## Core Concepts Explained

A: High-risk/high-reward asset with extreme volatility. Experts recommend allocating <5% of crypto portfolios.
