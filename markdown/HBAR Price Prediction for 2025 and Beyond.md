# HBAR Price Prediction for 2025 and Beyond  

## Understanding Hedera and Its Potential  
Hedera Hashgraph stands out in the blockchain technology landscape as a unique public distributed ledger. Unlike traditional blockchains, Hedera employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure combined with the Hashgraph consensus mechanism. This innovative approach enables high transaction throughput, low fees, and robust security while maintaining compatibility with smart contracts. As a platform for decentralized apps (dApps) and digital asset creation, Hedera's native cryptocurrency, HBAR, plays a critical role in network governance and transaction settlement.
