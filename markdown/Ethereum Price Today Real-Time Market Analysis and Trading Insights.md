## FAQs: Ethereum Market Dynamics

**Q: Why is Ethereum's price declining?**  
A: Current market conditions reflect macroeconomic uncertainty and profit-taking after recent rallies. The crypto market typically experiences 15-20% corrections following strong bullish phases.

**Q: Is Ethereum a good investment now?**  
A: Fundamental indicators remain positive with institutional adoption increasing. However, short-term volatility requires careful position sizing and risk management.
