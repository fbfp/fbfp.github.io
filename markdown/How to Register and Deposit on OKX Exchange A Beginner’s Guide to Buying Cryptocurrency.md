## Step 4: Funding Your Account via C2C Trading  

Once your account is verified, you can deposit funds to start trading. For beginners, **peer-to-peer (C2C)** trading is a popular method to purchase **USDT** (Tether) before buying other cryptocurrencies.  

### 4.1 Why Start with USDT?  
USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, making it ideal for beginners to enter the market without exposure to extreme price volatility.

4. **Complete the transaction**: Transfer funds to the seller via your preferred payment method (e.g., bank transfer, Alipay, or WeChat Pay).  
5. **Confirm receipt**: Once the seller verifies your payment, your USDT will be released to your OKX wallet.  

### 4.3 Tips for Avoiding Frozen Accounts  
- **Use trusted payment methods**: Opt for bank transfers over third-party apps like WeChat Pay.  
- **Keep transaction records**: Save screenshots and correspondence in case of disputes.  
- **Avoid suspicious sellers**: Check user reviews and prefer those with verified badges.
