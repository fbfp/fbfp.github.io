# XRP Will Get Relisted On Coinbase Immediately After Ripple’s Victory Over SEC, Exchange’s Chief Legal Officer Confirms  

When Ripple secures a favorable ruling against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Coinbase’s potential relisting of XRP could reshape the cryptocurrency landscape. This analysis explores the implications of the ongoing legal battle, Coinbase’s strategic considerations, and the broader impact on crypto markets.  

## **Will Coinbase Relist XRP Promptly?**  

The SEC’s 2020 lawsuit against Ripple triggered widespread delistings of XRP, including from Coinbase. At the time, the exchange cited compliance with its **Digital Assets Framework**, which evaluates tokens based on regulatory risks. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), recently addressed this contentious issue during an interview with Tony Edward of the *Thinking Crypto* podcast.  

Grewal emphasized that Coinbase’s decision to relist **XRP** hinges on several factors:  
1. **Legal grounds of the ruling**: The court’s reasoning in the SEC v. Ripple case.  
2. **Judicial precedent**: Whether higher courts might overturn the decision.  
3. **Regulatory clarity**: The SEC’s potential response to the verdict.  

While acknowledging the frustration of XRP holders, Grewal stressed Coinbase’s responsibility as a publicly traded company to prioritize compliance:  
> “A lot depends on the specifics of the court’s ruling. We’ll tread carefully but begin our review process immediately once the verdict is announced.”  

This statement signals cautious optimism for XRP investors, suggesting Coinbase could reinstate the token swiftly if regulatory risks diminish.

## **Legal Framework and Market Reactions**  

The SEC’s lawsuit centered on whether XRP qualifies as an unregistered security. Coinbase’s delisting in 2020 reflected broader industry concerns about regulatory uncertainty. However, Ripple’s legal team, led by General Counsel Stuart Alderoty, has aggressively challenged the SEC’s stance, arguing that XRP functions as a currency rather than an investment contract.  

Grewal praised Ripple’s legal strategy, calling it “masterful” and highlighting its role in exposing flaws in the SEC’s regulatory approach. This admiration aligns with Coinbase’s own efforts to support Ripple’s case through an *amicus curiae* (friend of the court) brief, underscoring the exchange’s vested interest in establishing clearer crypto regulations.  

## **FAQ: Addressing Key Questions**  

### **1. What triggers Coinbase’s review of XRP relisting?**  
The exchange will initiate its assessment immediately after the court’s ruling, focusing on the legal reasoning and potential appellate challenges.  

### **2. Could Coinbase relist XRP even if the SEC appeals?**  
Grewal indicated this depends on the ruling’s robustness. If the decision withstands scrutiny, relisting becomes more likely.  

### **3. How long might the relisting process take?**  
While Coinbase aims for speed, compliance reviews typically require weeks. A favorable ruling by mid-2024 could expedite timelines.

## **Coinbase’s Strategic Alignment with Ripple**  

By filing an amicus brief in Ripple’s favor, Coinbase demonstrated its commitment to challenging the SEC’s overreach. Grewal’s public endorsement of Ripple’s legal team further solidifies this alliance, positioning both entities as advocates for a more transparent regulatory environment.  

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously speculated the case could conclude by June 2024, though he cautioned that predictions remain uncertain. A ruling in Ripple’s favor would not only validate XRP’s classification as a non-security but also set a precedent for other tokens facing similar scrutiny.  

## **Implications for the Crypto Industry**  

The SEC v. Ripple case has become a bellwether for crypto regulation. A win for Ripple could:  
- **Reduce compliance risks** for exchanges listing XRP.  
- **Boost investor confidence** in utility tokens.  
- **Pressure the SEC** to provide clearer guidelines for digital assets.  

Coinbase’s potential relisting would symbolize a turning point, signaling institutional acceptance of XRP as a legitimate asset class. Competitors like Binance and Kraken might follow suit, reigniting liquidity and trading volumes.  

## **FAQ: Market and Regulatory Impact**  

### **4. How might a Ripple victory affect other cryptocurrencies?**  
A favorable ruling could weaken the SEC’s case against tokens like Ethereum (pre-Merge) and Litecoin, reshaping enforcement strategies.  

### **5. What risks remain for Coinbase post-ruling?**  
Regulatory shifts or political pressure could prompt the SEC to pursue alternative legal avenues, prolonging uncertainty.  

### **6. Could XRP relisting boost Coinbase’s market share?**  
Yes. Reinstating a high-demand asset like XRP could attract retail and institutional users, enhancing the exchange’s competitive edge.
