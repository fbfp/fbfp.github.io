# Copy Trading FAQ: Essential Guide for Traders

## Why Did My Copy Trade Order Fail?

Several technical and account-related factors might prevent successful trade replication:

1. **Lead Trader Status Changes**: The trader you follow might have paused their lead trader activities or lost eligibility due to policy violations.
2. **Daily Trade Limits**: Top traders often hit system-imposed caps on daily trade volume.
3. **Risk Control Triggers**: Automatic risk management systems might block trades that exceed predefined volatility thresholds.
4. **Insufficient Funds**: Ensure your account maintains adequate margin for position sizing.
5. **Spread Protection Limits**: Extreme market conditions might temporarily suspend order execution.
6. **Personal Copy Limits**: Review your account's maximum copy trade amount settings.

## What Causes Copy Trade Position Closures?

Positions can close through multiple mechanisms:

### Manual Closures
- **Copy Trader Actions**: 
  - Web: Trade > Positions > Select specific position
  - App: User Center > Copy Trading > My Copies > Open Orders
- **Lead Trader Actions**: When original traders close positions, all copied positions follow suit

### Automatic Closures
- **Take Profit/Stop Loss**: Predefined levels automatically lock in gains or limit losses
- **Liquidation Events**: 
  - Margin calls triggered by insufficient equity
  - Cascade liquidations during high volatility periods
