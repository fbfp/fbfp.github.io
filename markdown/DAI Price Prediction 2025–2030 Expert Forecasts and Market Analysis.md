## Understanding DAI: Core Features and Functionality  

DAI (DAI) is an Ethereum-based stablecoin soft-pegged to the US dollar, designed to maintain a 1:1 value ratio. Unlike centralized stablecoins, DAI operates through the **Maker Protocol**, a decentralized system requiring users to lock crypto assets like ETH, WBTC, or UNI as collateral in smart contracts to mint new tokens.  

### Key Differentiators  
- **Decentralized Stability**: Governed by MakerDAO, DAI eliminates single points of failure common in traditional stablecoins.  
- **Collateral Backing**: Over-collateralized loans ensure liquidity even during market volatility.  
- **Defi Integration**: Widely used for lending, borrowing, and yield farming across platforms like Aave and Curve Finance.

## Historical Context and Technical Foundations  

Launched in December 2017, DAI evolved from Single-Collateral DAI (SAI) to Multi-Collateral DAI in 2019, broadening its asset base. The protocol uses **Maker Vaults**â€”smart contracts where users deposit collateral to generate DAI.

## Factors Driving DAI's Price Volatility  

While DAI aims for $1 stability, its price fluctuates due to:  
1. **Market Demand**: Increased borrowing during bull markets drives DAI supply.  
2. **Collateral Health**: Volatility in ETH or WBTC values impacts liquidation risks.  
3. **Macro Trends**: Interest rate changes and crypto regulatory shifts influence investor sentiment.  
4. **Competitive Landscape**: Rival stablecoins like USDC or FRAX affect DAI's market share.
