## Security Considerations for Altcoin Transfers  
When moving small-cap tokens between chains, security remains paramount. Key risks include:  
- **Smart contract vulnerabilities** in newer bridges  
- **Liquidity fragmentation** causing excessive slippage  
- **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)** exploitation  

Top platforms mitigate these through:  
1. **Decentralized relayer networks** (Across Protocol)  
2. **Optimistic verification models** (Arbitrum Bridge)  
3. **Multi-signature governance** (Synapse Protocol)
