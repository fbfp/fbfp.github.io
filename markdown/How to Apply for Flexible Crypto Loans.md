# How to Apply for Flexible Crypto Loans  

Cryptocurrency lending platforms offer users the ability to leverage their digital assets for instant liquidity. This guide provides a step-by-step process for accessing flexible borrowing options, along with critical information about collateral requirements, interest rates, and risk management strategies.  

## Step-by-Step Borrowing Process  

### 1. Access the Lending Platform  
Open the app, navigate to **Finance > Lending**, and select **Borrow Now**. This interface connects you to real-time market data and dynamic loan parameters.  

### 2. Configure Your Loan  
Choose your desired borrowing currency and amount. Select either single-asset or multi-asset collateral options based on your portfolio strategy. For example, you might:  
- Borrow 50,000 USDT using 1 BTC as collateral  
- Borrow 10 ETH using a diversified basket of stablecoins  

### 3. Review Terms and Confirm  
Carefully examine the **Flexible Loan Service Agreement** and **Automatic Currency Conversion Rules** before confirming. These documents outline liquidation thresholds, interest rate adjustments, and platform responsibilities.  

### 4. Finalize Transaction  
Complete the transaction with a single confirmation. Funds typically appear in your account within 30 seconds, ready for trading, transfers, or other uses.

## Critical Loan Parameters  

### Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV) Explained  
Your borrowing capacity depends on two primary factors:  
1. **Account Leverage Tier**: Higher-tier accounts access increased loan limits  
2. **Position Margin Requirements**: Platform-determined thresholds based on asset volatility  

| Leverage Tier | USDT Maximum Loan | ETH Maximum Loan |  
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|  
| Tier 1        | $3,500,000        | $150,000         |  
| Tier 2        | $7,500,000        | $320,000         |  
| Tier 3        | $15,000,000       | $650,000         |  

*Example: A Tier 1 account with 2.5x leverage can borrow up to $3.5M USDT regardless of platform capacity*  

### Interest Rate Mechanisms  
Our dynamic pricing model updates hourly rates based on:  
- Market demand for specific assets  
- Collateral asset liquidity scores  
- Platform funding costs  

This ensures competitive rates while maintaining system stability.  

## Risk Management Essentials  

### Liquidation Thresholds  
Each collateral asset has a unique discount rate affecting liquidation points:  
- BTC: 85% discount rate â†’ 15% buffer before liquidation  
- ETH: 80% discount rate â†’ 20% buffer before liquidation  
- Stablecoins: 95% discount rate â†’ 5% buffer before liquidation  

When adding new collateral, the system first strengthens existing positions before approving additional loans.  

### Forced Repayment Protocols  
The platform maintains safety margins through:  
1. **Priority Liquidation**: Selling lower conversion ratio assets first  
2. **Value Preservation**: Handling identical discount ratio assets by liquidating higher-value positions first  

This systematic approach protects both individual and platform-wide solvency.

## Frequently Asked Questions  

### How does collateral valuation work?  
Loan values calculate using real-time spot prices from multiple exchanges. This ensures fair valuation and prevents manipulation.  

### Can I borrow the same asset I'm using as collateral?  
No, borrowing and collateral assets must remain distinct. This prevents circular dependencies and maintains system integrity.  

### What happens after repayment?  
Released collateral becomes available once all associated risks clear. Assets with low discount rates may require additional time for verification.  

### How are interest rates determined?  
Rates adjust hourly based on:  
- Asset-specific supply/demand dynamics  
- Network congestion metrics  
- Risk assessment models  

### Does staking collateral affect rewards?  
No. For example, using BETH (Ethereum 2.0 staking tokens) as collateral continues earning staking rewards.  

### What triggers forced liquidation?  
Exceeding platform-wide borrowing limits for specific assets initiates liquidation. The system prioritizes risk reduction while minimizing user impact.  

## Advanced Borrowing Strategies  

### Collateral Optimization  
Maintain a diversified collateral portfolio to:  
- Reduce volatility exposure  
- Access better LTV ratios  
- Qualify for premium account benefits  

### Interest Rate Arbitrage  
Monitor hourly rate changes to:  
- Time borrowings during low-demand periods  
- Lock in favorable rates through strategic repayments  
- Reborrow during rate dips for cost optimization  

### Position Management  
Regularly review your loan-to-collateral ratio, especially during high market volatility. Consider these thresholds:  
- 80% LTV: Consider adding collateral  
- 90% LTV: Warning level (prepare for potential liquidation)  
- 95% LTV: Immediate risk of forced liquidation
