# How to Create an imToken Cold Wallet: Step-by-Step Guide

## What Is a Cold Wallet?  
A **cold wallet** is a secure offline storage solution for cryptocurrency private keys. Unlike hot wallets connected to the internet, cold wallets isolate sensitive data from digital threats like hacking attempts and unauthorized access. This offline approach ensures your funds remain protected even during widespread cyberattacks.

### Cold Wallet vs. Hot Wallet: Key Differences  
| Feature                | Cold Wallet                | Hot Wallet                  |  
|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|  
| **Internet Connection**| Offline                    | Online                      |  
| **Security Level**     | High (reduced attack surface) | Lower (vulnerable to breaches) |  
| **Transaction Speed**  | Slower (requires manual steps) | Faster (instant transactions) |  

Cold wallets are ideal for long-term storage of large crypto holdings, while hot wallets suit frequent traders.
