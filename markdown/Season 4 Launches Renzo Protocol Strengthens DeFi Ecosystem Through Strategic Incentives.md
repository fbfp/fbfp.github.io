# Season 4 Launches: Renzo Protocol Strengthens DeFi Ecosystem Through Strategic Incentives  

Renzo Protocol continues its mission to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi) with the launch of Season 4, building on the success of its predecessor. Following Season 3â€™s "Amore" campaignâ€”which saw liquidity surge across DeFi integrations and Total Value Locked (TVL) rebound to $1.8 billionâ€”the protocol introduces new token incentives to further solidify its ecosystem. This season focuses on distributing 75 million REZ tokens over four months to reward liquidity providers and attract fresh capital.
