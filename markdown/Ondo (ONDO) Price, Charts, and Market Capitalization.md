## What Is Ondo?  

### Decentralized Finance Meets Institutional Infrastructure  
Ondo Finance operates at the intersection of blockchain technology and traditional finance, creating a hybrid ecosystem where real-world assets (RWAs) are tokenized and accessible to global investors. Founded in 2022 and headquartered in the Cayman Islands, the platform leverages its unique governance structure to empower users while maintaining regulatory compliance.  

The ONDO token serves as the backbone of this ecosystem, functioning as both a governance tool and incentive mechanism. With over 18,000 individual token holders as of mid-2022, Ondo's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) ensures community-driven decision-making for protocols like Flux Finance. This model democratizes financial innovation, allowing token holders to shape the platform's development and risk management strategies.
