# Major Exchanges Gemini, Kraken, and Bitstamp Resume XRP Trading After Landmark Court Ruling

## Court Ruling Clarifies XRP's Regulatory Status

On Thursday, US District Judge Analisa Torres delivered a pivotal decision regarding Ripple Labs Inc.'s XRP token. The ruling confirmed that programmatic sales of XRP do not constitute unregistered securities offerings, while institutional sales violated securities regulations. This verdict resolves a prolonged legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, marking a significant milestone for cryptocurrency regulatory clarity.

The court's statement emphasized:
> "Based on the totality of circumstances, the Court finds that reasonable investors, situated in the position of the Institutional Buyers, would have purchased XRP with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple‚Äôs efforts."

This distinction between institutional and programmatic sales establishes critical precedent for cryptocurrency classification frameworks.

## Exchange Reactions and Trading Resumptions

Following the court's decision, multiple cryptocurrency exchanges announced plans to relist XRP. Coinbase pioneered this movement, preparing to reintroduce XRP trading pairs (USD, USDT, EUR) once sufficient liquidity is established. Subsequently, Gemini, Kraken, and Bitstamp confirmed their intentions to resume XRP trading:

### Gemini Exchange
The platform tweeted:
> "Given today's ruling that the sale of XRP on exchanges is not a security, @Gemini is exploring the listing of XRP for both spot and derivatives trading."

### Kraken Exchange
Kraken announced expanded trading options:
> "üì¢ New token available for USA ü¶Öüá∫üá∏  
> ‚úîÔ∏è $XRP @Ripple  
> ‚úîÔ∏è Trading is now LIVE"

### Bitstamp
As Ripple holds a minority stake in Bitstamp, its US platform became one of the first to reactivate XRP trading, enabling buy/sell functionality for American users.

The ruling triggered immediate market reactions:
- **30% price surge** within hours of the verdict
- **77% increase** over 24 hours (highest since April 2022)
